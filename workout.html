                        I am going to use this page to explain what I have done so far, and I am still hoping to accomplish.
                        I was able to create a list of workout routines that are triggered by buttons related to the various wokrouts.
                        To make sure the buttons only triggered once, I replaced them with checkmarks on command. The list also has a 
                        delete button which cancels the list with the intention of allowing resubmission. The list does delete now, but 
                        the resubmission aspect is still flawed. I also plan on shifting that list to this workouts page. I intend to create 
                        a save button for the list, which will transfer the data to a my profile account to track consistant progress. I will also soon 
                        create a nutrition section to the project which should encompass things such as caloric intake and links to nutrition websites. 
                        When all of the important Javascript is completed, i intend to go back and seperate the CSS from the HTML pages, to make the project
                        cleaner and better organized. 
                    </p></center>
